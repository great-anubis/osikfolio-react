        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Great Osikhueme, a Full Stack Developer living in New York. 
          I'm studying Computer Science at Mercy University, where I'm gaining expertise 
          in both front-end and back-end development. One of my focus areas is machine 
          learning. I had the opportunity to showcase my skills in a project called 
          'Iris Insights; Blooming Machine Learning.' It's all about visualizing data 
          and uncovering its stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've had a foundation through the Techwise Cohort 2 Program supported by 
          Google, which has allowed me to acquire various skills, from React for 
          creating user interfaces to NodeJS for server-side development. Additionally, 
          I have experience with Python. I even dabbled in game development using Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working as an IT Specialist Assistant at Mercy College has sharpened my 
          problem-solving abilities, while my dedication to community service and 
          leadership shines through my work with Buildon. Whether developing web 
          applications like 'Painter' or simulating ecosystems with 'Hangry Boids,' my 
          main objective is always to provide solutions that excel in performance and 
          user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, you'll often find me leading projects and collaborating 
          with peers. Together, we can push the boundaries of technology and create 
          solutions that make an impact. Let's connect and bring our ideas to life!
