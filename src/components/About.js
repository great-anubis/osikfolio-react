        <p>
          Hello! I'm Great Osikhueme, a passionate Full Stack Developer from New York City. 
          Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in Computer Science at Mercy University, 
          focusing on a blend of front-end, back-end, and machine learning technologies. 
          My journey has been significantly enriched by the Techwise Cohort 2 Program, backed by Google, 
          where I've honed my skills in React, NodeJS, and Python, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          My project portfolio includes 'Blooming Iris Insights,' a machine learning venture that explores the 
          intricacies of iris flower species classification through data visualization. 
          This project is a testament to my fascination with uncovering the narratives hidden within data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my academic pursuits, my role as an IT Specialist Assistant at Mercy University 
          has fine-tuned my technical and problem-solving skills. I've also dedicated myself to community service and leadership through BuildOn, 
          reflecting my commitment to making a meaningful impact beyond the digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
          From web development projects like creating sophisticated user interfaces to engaging in game development with Unity, 
          my ultimate goal is to deliver solutions that stand out for their performance and user experience. 
          'Hangry Boids,' a simulation game, is a prime example of my efforts to blend entertainment with technological innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the keyboard, I'm a project leader and collaborator, always eager to explore the limits of what we can achieve with technology. 
          I believe in the power of collective creativity to generate solutions that matter. I'm excited to connect and transform our ideas into reality!
